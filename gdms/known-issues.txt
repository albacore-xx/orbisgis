* If a dbf file has a record marked as 'deleted' it will be treated in gdms
as a row with null values.

* The following PostgreSQL datatypes are not supported: bit, bit varying,
box, cidr, circle, inet, interval, line, lseg, macaddr, money, path, point and
polygon. That means we can only deal with tables without this types.

* The 'OTHER' data type in hsqldb is not supported.

* H2 not supported types: OTHER, UUID, ARRAY

* If some source doesn't specify the geometry constraint or the geometry
constraint specified is "MIXED" and that source is exported to PostGIS the
table will have type "GEOMETRY" and dimension "3"
